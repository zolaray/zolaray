# Hi, I'm Rayane Fatima Zohra 👋
### Lead Developer | Spatio-Temporal AI Researcher 🚀

I am a research-oriented developer focused on the intersection of **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Explainable AI (XAI)**. My work aims to solve urban complexity through predictive modeling and agentic reasoning.

---

## 🔍 Featured Research Ecosystem
I have developed a modular dual-layer framework for Urban Intelligence:

* **[Urban-Logistics-Shenzhen](https://github.com/zolaray/Urban-Logistics-Shenzhen):** The Predictive Engine. An implementation of **T-GCN** and **ST-GNN** architectures for traffic flow forecasting on the SZ-Taxi dataset.
* **[UrbanGuard-XAI](https://github.com/zolaray/UrbanGuard-):** The Reasoning Layer. An **Agentic AI** framework that interprets GNN outputs to provide human-readable situational reports.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Deep Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, GNNs (T-GCN, A3T-GCN)
* **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy, OSMnx, Spatio-temporal Data Mining
* **Agents:** LLM Orchestration, LangChain, XAI
* **Engineering:** Lead Developer experience in Full-Stack AI deployment
